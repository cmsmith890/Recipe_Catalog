# Recipe Generator Services Documentation

This document describes the components found in the `Recipe_Generator.Services` namespace, which includes service implementations, the database context, model definitions, and interface contracts. The code is designed with debugging in mind (using `[DebuggerDisplay]` attributes) and includes placeholder implementations for asynchronous methods.

## Overview

The `Recipe_Generator.Services` namespace contains the core services for managing recipes within the Recipe Generator application. The main components include:

- **RecipeService**: Implements the `IRecipeService` interface and provides asynchronous CRUD operations. Several method overloads are defined, some of which include placeholder implementations.
- **RecipeDbContext**: An Entity Framework Core `DbContext` responsible for managing the `Recipes` entity set.
- **Recipe Model**: A simple class that defines a recipe with an `Id`, `Name`, and `Category`.
- **IRecipeService Interface**: Specifies the contract for recipe management operations.
- **RecipeServiceExtensions**: A static class that provides additional extension methods related to recipe services.

## RecipeService Class

The `RecipeService` class implements `IRecipeService` and `IEquatable<RecipeService>`. It is decorated with the `[DebuggerDisplay]` attribute, which uses the `GetDebuggerDisplay()` method for enhanced debugging.

### Key Methods

- **`AddRecipeAsync(Recipe recipe)`**  
  Adds a recipe asynchronously.  
  _Placeholder implementation using `Task.CompletedTask`._

- **`DeleteRecipeAsync(int id)`**  
  Deletes a recipe asynchronously based on the provided ID.  
  _Placeholder implementation using `Task.CompletedTask`._

- **`GetCategoriesAsync()`**  
  Returns a distinct list of recipe categories asynchronously.  
  _Placeholder implementation returns an empty list._

- **`GetRecipeByIdAsync(int id)`**  
  Retrieves a recipe by its ID asynchronously.  
  _Placeholder implementation returns `null`._

- **`GetRecipes(Recipe recipeList)`**  
  Returns a list of recipes based on the provided recipe list.  
  _Placeholder implementation returns an empty list._

- **`GetRecipesAsync()`**  
  Retrieves a list of recipes asynchronously.  
  _Placeholder implementation returns an empty list._

- **Overloaded `GetRecipesAsync` Methods**  
  Additional overloads accept different parameters (e.g., a list of recipes or combining two lists) and are implemented as placeholders.

- **`UpdateRecipeAsync(Recipe recipe)`**  
  Updates a recipe asynchronously.  
  _Placeholder implementation using `Task.CompletedTask`._

- **`GetRecipeAsync(int id)`**  
  A convenience method that calls `GetRecipeByIdAsync(int id)`.

### Debugger Display

The `[DebuggerDisplay]` attribute uses the `GetDebuggerDisplay()` method to return the string representation of the object, aiding in debugging.

```csharp
private string GetDebuggerDisplay()
{
    return ToString() ?? string.Empty;
}
